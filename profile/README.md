# OpenImageLab

OpenImageLab is a community-driven initiative dedicated to helping users improve and correct digital images using high-quality open-source software. Our goal is to provide clear, accessible guidance for the entire imaging workflow — from initial capture to final output — whether the source is a digital camera, a smartphone, or scanned film negatives and slides.

Photographs often represent important moments in life: weddings, the birth of a child, family celebrations, or unforgettable trips. When these images turn out too dark, too bright, poorly exposed, or disrupted by unwanted elements, the disappointment can be significant. The good news is that many “failed” or seemingly lost images can be recovered. With the right knowledge and workflow, users can restore and enhance their photos without requiring expensive commercial tools.

## What We Do

### Image Processing Guidance
We help beginners and enthusiasts learn practical image-processing techniques using open-source tools such as Darktable, RawTherapee, GIMP, and related utilities. Our tutorials and documentation focus on clarity, repeatable workflows, and step-by-step explanations.

### Hardware & Workflow Advice
We offer guidance on choosing and using scanners, digital cameras, monitors, printers, and other imaging equipment. Our aim is to support users in building a reliable end-to-end workflow from capture to display or print.

### Open Resources & Community Collaboration
OpenImageLab maintains repositories, presets, style files, example images, and educational material. We encourage contributions from anyone who wishes to improve tutorials, share expertise, or help develop new resources.

## Mission

Our mission is to make high-quality image processing accessible to everyone. We strive to:

- Enable users to recover and improve important photographs.  
- Promote powerful open-source alternatives to commercial photo software.  
- Share practical workflows that simplify complex imaging concepts.  
- Support both digital and analog photographers, including hybrid film-to-digital workflows.  
- Build a collaborative space where knowledge grows collectively.

## Resources

Documentation and tutorials will be available across the organization’s repositories and wiki. Additional learning material — including presets, sample workflows, and reference images — will be added over time as the project expands.

## Contributing

OpenImageLab welcomes contributions from the community. Whether you want to refine documentation, create new tutorials, test workflows, or share your knowledge, your participation is appreciated. Contribution guidelines will be published as the project evolves.

## License

All content within OpenImageLab repositories is covered by the licenses specified in each project.  
Documentation typically uses a Creative Commons license, while software components and presets may use an open-source license.
